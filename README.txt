# WANDS Research Project

This project is a research product developed for the **WANDS repository**. 

## **ðŸ”¹ Overview**
We utilize a **BERT-based model** to generate embeddings for various queries and store them in **Pinecone**, a high-performance vector database. To enable efficient retrieval, we have developed a **FastAPI microservice** that processes any query and returns the **top 10 most similar results**.

## **ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used**
- **BERT**: Used to generate vector embeddings.
- **Pinecone**: Stores embeddings for fast similarity searches.
- **FastAPI**: Provides an API to process queries and return approximate matches.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for development and experimentation.

## **ðŸ”¹ How to Run the Project**
To execute all the code and set up the environment, simply run:
bash execute.bash

This script will create the virtual environment, install dependencies, and start the FastAPI microservice.
